This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), then extended with ts-jest setup instructions from [this Medium article on unit testing with Typescript & React](https://medium.com/@feralamillo/create-react-app-typescript-testing-with-jest-and-enzyme-869fdba1bd3).

Unfortnuately, this demo project still seems to have an issue importing some libraries, but I will continue to pursue how to overcome that shortcoming.
